> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

I'm trying to solve each problem as quickly as possible during my lunch break. This means most solutions will probably be rough and definitely not optimal. As long as I get to the right answer quickly enough, it's all good. üëç
